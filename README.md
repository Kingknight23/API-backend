# Architecture-Overview
- Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across microservices (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer, NGINX).
- Service Discovery: Tracks available microservices (e.g., Consul, Eureka).
- Containerization & Orchestration:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
- Logging & Monitoring:
  - Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki
  - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Message Broker: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for inter-service communication.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD for deployment.
  
# Microservices
1. ## User Service
- Responsibility: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
- Database: UserDB: Stores user data (users, roles, preferences).
- Key Features:
  - Authentication (JWT or OAuth2)
  - Role-based access control (e.g., User, Event Manager)
- Technologies:
  - Backend: Node.js with Express, Spring Boot, or Django
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
  - Authentication: Firebase Auth, Okta, or Keycloak

2. ## Event Service
- Responsibility: Event managers can create, update, delete, and manage events.
- Database:
  - EventDB: Stores event data (event_id, title, description, location, date, capacity, etc.).
- Key Features:
  - CRUD for events
  - Event search and filtering
  - Integration with User Service for role validation
- Technologies:
  - Backend: Spring Boot, Flask, or Express.js
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
  - Search: Elasticsearch or Solr

3. ## Booking Service
- Responsibility: Handles users' booking of events.
- Database:
  - BookingDB: Stores booking data (booking_id, user_id, event_id, status).
- Key Features:
  - Create/Cancel bookings
  - Track available seats
  - Notify users of successful booking
- Technologies:
  - Backend: Node.js with NestJS or Spring Boot
  - Database: PostgreSQL (with ACID compliance for transactions)
  - Messaging: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka (for booking notifications)

4. ## Payment Service
- Responsibility: Handles payment processing for event bookings.
- Database:
  - PaymentDB: Stores payment data (payment_id, user_id, amount, status, transaction_details).
- Key Features:
  - Payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
  - Refund and transaction history
- Technologies:
  - Backend: FastAPI, Express.js, or Spring Boot
  - Payment Gateway: Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay
  - Database: PostgreSQL or DynamoDB

5. ## Notification Service
- Responsibility: Sends email and SMS notifications for events and bookings.
- Database:
  - NotificationDB: Stores notification logs (user_id, message_type, timestamp).
- Key Features:
  - Email and SMS notifications
  - Push notifications
- Technologies:
  - Backend: Node.js with Express or Python Celery
  - Notification APIs: Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase Cloud Messaging
  - Database: Redis (for queues) and MongoDB

6. ## Analytics Service
- Responsibility: Provides insights into user activity, booking trends, and event performance.
- Database:
  - AnalyticsDB: Stores aggregated and raw event-related data.
- Key Features:
  - Collect metrics like bookings per event, user activity
  - Generate reports for event managers
- Technologies:
  - Backend: Python with Flask or Java Spring Boot
  - Database: Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, or Google BigQuery
  - Visualization: Tableau, Grafana, or Power BI

7. ## API Gateway
- Responsibility: Provides a single entry point for clients and routes requests to appropriate microservices.
- Technologies: Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway
- Security: OAuth2/JWT

8. ## Frontend Service
- Responsibility: User interface for the web application.
  - Technologies:
- Frameworks: React.js, Angular, or Vue.js
- State Management: Redux, Vuex
- Styling: CSS, Bootstrap

# Database-Layout
- UserDB: users, roles, sessions
- EventDB: events, categories, locations
- BookingDB: bookings, transactions
- PaymentDB: payments, refunds
- NotificationDB: notifications, logs
- AnalyticsDB: metrics, aggregations

This setup ensures scalability, resilience, and separation of concerns, making maintaining and extending the application easier.
